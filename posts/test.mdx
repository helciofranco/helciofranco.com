## What I used on this blog

With Next, you have a few different options when it comes to page
rendering: you can choose to do it “on-demand” (
**server-side rendering**) or ahead of time (
**static site generation**). I&rsquo;ve opted to build all the blog
posts ahead of time, when the site is generated.

Lets say you have a `PackingList` component rendering several Items, which can be marked as packed or not:

<Snippet language="jsx" code={`
const Test = ({ children }) => {
  return <App />;
}
`} />

This is a list in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com) markdown:

- One
- Two
- Three
